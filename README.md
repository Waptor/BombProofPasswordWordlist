# Bomb-Proof Password Wordlist
A tiny but effective wordlist for cracking the Navy SEAL "bomb proof" password scheme

I recently saw tacticalrifleman's video over on the Clock App (https://www.tiktok.com/@tacticalrifleman/video/7290736419474132257) and realised that this super cool password generation scheme (as shown) can be cracked with a wordlist of exactly nine entries. Enjoy!
